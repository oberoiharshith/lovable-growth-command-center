# Executive Summary — Lovable Growth Command Center (POC)

## Goal
Turn user → AI interaction data into decisions that get users to “aha” faster and improve retention.

## North star metrics
- Activation: **ship within 48 hours**
- 7-day retention: **return_session between day 1 and day 7**
- Time-to-aha proxies: time to first output, early errors, latency

## What the dashboard is meant to answer
- Where do users drop in the funnel?
- Which segments activate better (intent, channel, platform)?
- What levers matter most (templates, errors, latency)?
- What experiments should we run next?

## Recommended bets
1) Intent-based template suggestions at first prompt
2) Debug helper when users hit 2+ errors in first session
3) Latency guardrails on first output path (p95 reduction)
